Flash 4 lasers on a fiberoptic cape
I am using and Arduino Uno to randomly flash 4 lasers that run on 5 volts. This is the code I am using. I keep getting error code about "High" not being declared. I can find no examples that declare "High"
THis is my code:  
  //this variable will hold a random number generated by the random() function
long randomNumber;
 
// setup is run just once when the micro:bit starts up
void setup() {
  // define constants for each LED pin
  const int LED_1 = 0;
  const int LED_2 = 1;
  const int LED_3 = 2;
  const int LED_4 = 3;



    //set the LED pins as outputs
  pinMode(LED_1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LED_2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LED_3, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LED_4, OUTPUT); 

  //Let's make it more random
  randomSeed(42);   
}

void loop() {
 // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  //assign a random number to our variable
  randomNumber = random(1,5);

  //turn on a "Random LED"
  ;digitalWrite(randomNumber, High);

  //delay to see the LED light up
  delay(100)

  //turn LED off
  ;digitalwrite(randomNumber,  LOW);
}
The error code is: "High" was not declared in this scope

What am I doing wrong?
